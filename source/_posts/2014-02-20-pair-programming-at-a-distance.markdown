draft

I assume that the majority of my readers will be familiar with the term pair-programming but for the sake of clarity, I will define pair-programming as I understand it.

{% blockquote %}
Pair programming is a technique in which two programmers jointly produce one artifact, such as a design, an algorithm, or some code.
{% endblockquote %}

It is a style of programming that has been proven to facilitate higher productivity, produce idiomatic code, reduce bus factor and improve communication and collaboration.

It is also damm hard and not for everyone.
If you are uncomfortable pair-programming but still keep doing it you might be doing more damage by forcing yourself to do it than you are gaining value.

Many companies like Pivotal Labs, Unboxed Consulting, 8th Light and Living Social consider pair-programming to be a core part of their business but find themselves faced with the problem of having teams, developers and offices across cities, borders and continents.

Remote work is a reality and we have created and adjusted our tools and processes to better facilitate it.

But pair-programming often falls by the wayside and developers are provided with isolated pieces of work contradicting the collaborative nature that most our companies aspire to.

The aim of this essay is to provide you with some guidelines to becoming a better remote pair-programmer.

{% blockquote %}
PROTIP: The no 1 thing you can do to become a better remote pair-programmer is to become a better pair-programmer.

Whatever this person might be called in your team they can make pair-programming much more enjoyable and if you are that person do not forget this.

But outside of a shared workplace it becomes much harder to do that so we are going to need.
