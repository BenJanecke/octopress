The ideal of these essays are to reflect "me" and my opinions on things.

My thoughts, opinions, ideals, grammar and spelling are continuously changing and improving or in some cases getting worse. This site and its essays will change with them.

I believe in transparency so this change will be available on this [git repo](https://github.com/BenJanecke/octopress/commits/master).

I also believe in collaboration so pull requests are welcome at [this repo](https://github.com/BenJanecke/octopress).

Everything written here will never be removed the from the [git history](https://github.com/BenJanecke/octopress/commits/master) and will be subject to change.

That is the point.
